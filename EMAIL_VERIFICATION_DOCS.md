# Email Verification Implementation for Admin Panel

## Summary of Changes

Email verification has been successfully implemented for the admin registration system. Here's what was done:

### 1. Database Changes

**Migration: `2025_10_02_180307_create_admins_table.php`**

-   Added `email_verified_at` column (timestamp, nullable) to the admins table

**Migration: `2025_10_07_004959_add_email_verified_at_to_admins_table.php`**

-   Added migration to add the column to existing database

### 2. Model Updates

**File: `app/Models/Admin.php`**

-   Implements `MustVerifyEmail` interface
-   Added `email_verified_at` to fillable array
-   Added `email_verified_at` to casts as 'datetime'
-   Added custom `sendEmailVerificationNotification()` method to use custom notification

### 3. Custom Notification

**File: `app/Notifications/AdminVerifyEmail.php`**

-   Custom verification email notification
-   Generates signed URL for admin verification route
-   60-minute expiration on verification links

### 4. Controller Updates

**File: `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AuthController.php`**

-   Modified `register()` method to:
    -   Create admin user
    -   Log them in (required to access verification notice page)
    -   Send verification email
    -   Redirect to verification notice page

**File: `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/VerificationController.php`** (NEW)

-   `notice()` - Displays "verify your email" page
-   `verify($id, $hash)` - Handles verification link click with signature validation
-   `resend()` - Resends verification email

### 5. Middleware Updates

**File: `app/Http/Middleware/RedirectIfNotAdmin.php`**

-   Now checks if admin email is verified
-   Redirects to verification notice if not verified
-   Only allows verified admins to access protected routes

### 6. Routes

**File: `routes/web.php`**
Added verification routes:

-   `GET /admin/email/verify` - Shows verification notice (requires auth:admin)
-   `GET /admin/email/verify/{id}/{hash}` - Verifies email (signed URL)
-   `POST /admin/email/resend` - Resends verification email (requires auth:admin)

### 7. Views

**File: `resources/views/admin/auth/verify-email.blade.php`** (NEW)

-   Mobile-responsive verification notice page
-   Shows success/error/info messages
-   "Resend Verification Email" button
-   Logout option

### 8. Seeder Updates

**File: `database/seeders/AdminSeeder.php`**

-   Default admin user now has `email_verified_at` set to current timestamp
-   This allows the seeded admin to login immediately without verification

### 9. Mail Configuration

**File: `.env`**

-   Already configured with `MAIL_MAILER=log`
-   Emails will be logged to `storage/logs/laravel.log` for testing
-   Ready for production mail service (Mailtrap, Mailgun, etc.)

## How It Works

### Registration Flow:

1. User fills out registration form
2. Admin account is created
3. User is automatically logged in
4. Verification email is sent
5. User is redirected to verification notice page
6. User cannot access dashboard until email is verified

### Verification Flow:

1. User clicks verification link in email
2. Link is validated (signature, hash, expiration)
3. Email is marked as verified
4. User is redirected to login page with success message
5. User can now login and access the dashboard

### Login Flow:

1. User enters credentials
2. If authenticated but not verified, redirected to verification notice
3. If verified, redirected to dashboard

## Testing

### To test email verification:

1. **Register a new admin:**

    - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/admin/register`
    - Fill out the registration form
    - Submit

2. **Check the email log:**

    ```bash
    tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
    ```

    Look for the verification email with the verification link

3. **Click the verification link** or manually visit the URL from the log

4. **Try to login** after verification

### To test with existing admin:

-   Email: `admin@example.com`
-   Password: `password`
-   This admin is already verified and can login directly

## Production Setup

To use email verification in production:

1. **Update `.env` with real mail service:**

    ```env
    MAIL_MAILER=smtp
    MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io  # or your SMTP server
    MAIL_PORT=2525
    MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
    MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@yourdomain.com"
    MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
    ```

2. **Set APP_URL in `.env`:**
    ```env
    APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
    ```

## Security Features

-   ✅ Signed URLs with 60-minute expiration
-   ✅ Hash validation to prevent tampering
-   ✅ Middleware protection on all admin routes
-   ✅ Cannot access dashboard without verification
-   ✅ Verification links are single-use (already verified check)
