# ✅ Soft Delete Implemented for Admins

## What Was Added

Soft delete functionality has been added to the admins table. This allows you to "delete" admin records without permanently removing them from the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Admin Model (`app/Models/Admin.php`)

-   Added `use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;`
-   Added `SoftDeletes` trait to the model
-   Now admins can be soft deleted

### 2. Migration (`database/migrations/2025_10_08_000001_add_soft_deletes_to_admins_table.php`)

-   Added `deleted_at` timestamp column to admins table
-   This column stores the deletion timestamp

### 3. AdminController (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminController.php`)

-   Added `destroy()` method
-   Prevents admins from deleting themselves
-   Uses soft delete (doesn't permanently remove from database)

### 4. Routes (`routes/web.php`)

-   Added `destroy` to admins resource routes
-   Route: `DELETE /admin/admins/{id}`

### 5. Views Updated

**Index View (`resources/views/admin/admins/index.blade.php`)**

-   Added "Delete" button for each admin
-   Button is hidden for the currently logged-in admin
-   Includes confirmation dialog

**Show View (`resources/views/admin/admins/show.blade.php`)**

-   Added "Delete" button
-   Button is hidden if viewing your own profile
-   Includes confirmation dialog

## How It Works

### Soft Delete Behavior:

```php
// When you delete an admin
$admin->delete();

// The admin is NOT permanently deleted
// Instead, the deleted_at column is set to the current timestamp

// Soft deleted admins are automatically excluded from queries
Admin::all(); // Excludes soft deleted admins

// To include soft deleted admins
Admin::withTrashed()->get();

// To get only soft deleted admins
Admin::onlyTrashed()->get();

// To permanently delete
$admin->forceDelete();

// To restore a soft deleted admin
$admin->restore();
```

### Safety Features:

1. **Self-protection**: You cannot delete your own admin account
2. **Confirmation dialog**: Asks "Are you sure?" before deleting
3. **Recoverable**: Deleted admins can be restored
4. **Audit trail**: Keeps track of when admin was deleted

## Testing

### 1. Login as Admin

-   Email: `admin@example.com`
-   Password: `password`

### 2. Navigate to Admins

-   Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/admins

### 3. Create a Test Admin

-   Register a new admin (use different email)
-   Verify their email

### 4. Delete the Test Admin

**From Index Page:**

-   Click "Delete" next to the admin
-   Confirm the deletion
-   Admin disappears from the list

**From Show Page:**

-   View an admin's details
-   Click "Delete" button
-   Confirm the deletion
-   Redirected to admins list

### 5. Verify Soft Delete

Run in terminal:

```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> Admin::withTrashed()->get()
```

You'll see the deleted admin with a `deleted_at` timestamp.

## Restore Deleted Admins

To restore a soft deleted admin, run:

```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> $admin = Admin::withTrashed()->find(2);
>>> $admin->restore();
```

## Advanced Features

### View Deleted Admins

If you want to add a "Trash" view to see deleted admins:

**Controller Method:**

```php
public function trash()
{
    $admins = Admin::onlyTrashed()
        ->orderBy('deleted_at', 'desc')
        ->paginate(20);

    return view('admin.admins.trash', compact('admins'));
}
```

**Route:**

```php
Route::get('admins/trash', [AdminController::class, 'trash'])
    ->name('admin.admins.trash');
```

### Permanently Delete

To add permanent delete functionality:

```php
public function forceDestroy($id)
{
    $admin = Admin::withTrashed()->find($id);
    $admin->forceDelete(); // Permanently deletes

    return redirect()->route('admin.admins.trash')
        ->with('success', 'Admin permanently deleted.');
}
```

## Database Query Examples

```php
// Get all active admins (excludes deleted)
Admin::all();

// Get specific admin (only if not deleted)
Admin::find($id);

// Get all admins including deleted
Admin::withTrashed()->get();

// Get only deleted admins
Admin::onlyTrashed()->get();

// Check if admin is deleted
$admin->trashed(); // Returns true/false

// Restore deleted admin
$admin->restore();

// Permanently delete
$admin->forceDelete();
```

## Benefits of Soft Delete

✅ **Data Recovery**: Can restore accidentally deleted admins
✅ **Audit Trail**: Know when admins were deleted
✅ **Data Integrity**: Maintains relationships with other records
✅ **Safety**: Prevents permanent data loss
✅ **Compliance**: Helps with data retention policies

## Current Status

🟢 **Soft delete is now active for admins!**

-   Deleted admins are hidden from normal queries
-   Can be restored if needed
-   Cannot delete yourself
-   Confirmation required before deletion

## Next Steps

Consider adding soft deletes to:

-   ✅ Admins (DONE!)
-   ❓ Users
-   ❓ Form Submissions (already created migration, needs implementation)

Let me know if you want to implement soft deletes for other tables!
