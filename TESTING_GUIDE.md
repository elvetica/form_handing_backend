## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Email verification has been successfully implemented for admin registration. Here's how to test it:

## Server Status

The development server is running at: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Test Registration with Email Verification

**Step 1: Register a new admin**

-   Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/register
-   Fill in the form:
    -   Name: Test Admin
    -   Email: test@example.com
    -   Password: password123
    -   Confirm Password: password123
-   Click "Register"

**Expected Result:**

-   You'll be logged in automatically
-   Redirected to verification notice page
-   Success message: "Registration successful! Please check your email to verify your account."

**Step 2: Check the verification email**
Since we're using `MAIL_MAILER=log`, the email is written to the log file:

```bash
tail -50 storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Look for:

-   Subject: "Verify Email Address"
-   A verification link like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/email/verify/{id}/{hash}?expires=...&signature=...`

**Step 3: Copy the verification link**

-   Find the verification URL in the log
-   Copy the entire URL (including expires and signature parameters)
-   Paste it into your browser

**Expected Result:**

-   Redirected to login page
-   Success message: "Email verified successfully! You can now login."

**Step 4: Login**

-   Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login
-   Email: test@example.com
-   Password: password123

**Expected Result:**

-   Successfully logged in
-   Redirected to admin dashboard
-   Can access all admin features

### 2. Test Unverified Email Block

**Step 1: Register but don't verify**

-   Register a new admin (use different email)
-   Don't click the verification link

**Step 2: Try to access dashboard directly**

-   Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/dashboard

**Expected Result:**

-   Redirected to verification notice page
-   Cannot access dashboard until verified

### 3. Test Resend Verification Email

**Step 1: Be on the verification notice page**

-   Register a new admin or logout and login with unverified account

**Step 2: Click "Resend Verification Email" button**

**Expected Result:**

-   Success message: "Verification link sent!"
-   New email logged to laravel.log

### 4. Test Existing Admin (Already Verified)

The seeded admin is already verified:

-   Email: admin@example.com
-   Password: password

**Step 1: Login**

-   Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login
-   Use the credentials above

**Expected Result:**

-   Direct access to dashboard
-   No verification required
